Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE):
```
is an algorithm for quantum chemistry using near-term quantum computers .

Tunable Gates & Tunable Circuits:
```
that can be varied and rerun to produce better results each time. This is called a
tunable circuit and comes in many forms. Each form or template is called an
ansatz. Designing a good ansatz is the key to working with hybrid algorithms.

The gate operations used in creating a tunable circuit can include:
[^1]: Rx- This gate rotates 𝜃 radians around the x axis.
[^2]: Ry - This gate rotates 𝜃 radians around the y axis.
[^3]: Rz - This gate rotates 𝜃 radians around the z axis.
[^3]: CNOT - This gate is used to entangle qubits
